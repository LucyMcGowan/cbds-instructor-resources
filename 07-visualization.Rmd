## Exercise 1: Visualizing NBA Finals Data {-}

In this exercise we will work with [NBA final teams stats](https://www.kaggle.com/daverosenman/nba-finals-team-stats) on Kaggle. We have used this data before in the \@ref(tidying) course. There is two .csv files. The 'champs.csv' file contains game-by-game team totals for the championship team from every finals game between 1980 and 2017. The 'runnerups.csv' contains game-by-game team totals for the runner-up team from every finals game between 1980 and 2017. The 1980 NBA Finals was the first Finals series since the NBA added the three point line.

This exercise is inpired by two kernells on Kaggle that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/carterallen/nba-championship-data) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/daverosenman/nba-finals-three-point-stats-1980-2017). Ask your stduent to download the data on Kaggle or on our Github repository for this guide.

The first step is to import the data into R. Since importing .csv files is in a future lesson, tell your students the commands the need to import the .csv files. We are going to use `read_csv` command from the **readr** package. Ask them to save the two files in two separate objects. Here we called them `champs` and `runners`. Like before, we will tidy the data a bit to fix the team name issues and converting the columns `Win` and `Home` to factors.



```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
# importing the data
champs <- read_csv(file = "./data/nba/championsdata.csv")
runners <- read_csv(file = "./data/nba/runnerupsdata.csv")
# fix the heat and warriors
champs <- champs %>%
    mutate(Team = ifelse(Team == "Warriorrs","Warriors",Team)) %>%
    mutate(Team = ifelse(Team == "'Heat'","Heat",Team)) %>%
    mutate(Win = as.factor(Win)) %>%
    mutate(Home = as.factor(Home))

runners <- runners %>%
    mutate(Team = ifelse(Team == "Warriorrs","Warriors",Team)) %>%
    mutate(Team = ifelse(Team == "'Heat'","Heat",Team)) %>%
    mutate(Win = as.factor(Win)) %>%
    mutate(Home = as.factor(Home))
## bind the two data sets together
## and add a column that shows champions vs. runnerups call it rank
allteams <- bind_rows("Champion" = champs, "Runner" = runners, .id = "rank")
```


After importing and wrangling the data, ask your students to figure out whether *champion* teams are likely to score more at home or away. Ask them to write the code in a pipe and present the table using the **knitr** package. 


```{r}
## loading the knitr package
library(knitr)
## does home has an advantage
allteams %>%
    ## first filtering so we only look at champion teams
    filter(rank == "Champion") %>% 
    ## grouping by the variable home
    group_by(Home) %>% 
    ## calculating the average of points scored
    summarise(avg = mean(PTS)) %>% 
    ## presenting the table using the knitr package
    kable("html")
```

Ask your students what this means. To make the table above make more sense, ask your students to use the appropriate function for changing factor levels so that the column `Home` is equal to `Home` if its value is `1` and is equal to `Away` if its value is `0`. Your students should use the function `fct_recode()` in order to do that. Now they know that champion teams on average score 98.2 points at away games and 103.3 points at home games.

```{r}
## loading the knitr package
library(knitr)
## does home has an advantage
allteams %>%
    ## first filtering so we only look at champion teams
    filter(rank == "Champion") %>%
    ## changing factor levels so they mean better
    mutate(Home = fct_recode(Home, Home = "1", Away = "0")) %>% 
    ## grouping by the variable home
    group_by(Home) %>% 
    ## calculating the average of points scored
    summarise(avg = mean(PTS)) %>% 
    ## presenting the table using the knitr package
    kable("html")
```


Now, we are going to do some data visualization using the package **ggplot2**. Ask them to first find the column that contains the three point field goals from the data guide. The column is `TP`. Then ask them to show the average number of three points per year using a bar plot. Note that they will have to use the `geom_bar()` function from the **ggplot2** package. Ask them to use the title "NBA Finals, 1980-2018" as the title of the graph and "Average Three Point Field Goals" as the label for the Y axis. Note that they will have to use the argument `stat = 'identity'` inside the `geom_bar()` function.

```{r}
ggplot(data = allteams, aes(x = Year, y = TP)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
    ggtitle("NBA Finals, 1980-2018") +
    ylab('Average Three Point Field Goals') 
```

Now, ask them two repeat the pervious graph but this time, have the bar plot (with different colors) for champion and runner up teams. In other words, they will have to use the argument `fill` and make it equal to the newly created column `rank`. Then ask them to interpret the graph. What is obvious is that champion teams do a much better job at three-pointers.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = allteams, aes(x = Year, y = TP, fill = rank)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
    ggtitle("NBA Finals, 1980-2018") +
    ylab('Average Three Point Field Goals')
p
```

Now, ask them to find the right function in **ggplot2** that makes the Y axix ticks (the years) with an angle (45 degrees). They will have to use the `theme()` argument and inside it they will have to use the `element_text()` function to specify the angle. 

```{r}
p + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))
```

In the last exercises, we are going to work with scatter plots. Ask your students have a scatter plot with number of 3 pointers per game on the vertical axis and year on the horizontal axis. Note that the two columns they need to use are `TP` and `Year`. Ask them to have two different colors for champions and runner ups. Ask them to make the point sizes equal to 1. 

```{r}
p2 = ggplot(data = allteams, aes(x = Year, y = TP, color = rank)) +
    geom_point(size = 1) +
    ylab('3 Pointers per game')

p2
```

Your students are now required to use the `geom_smooth()` function from the **ggplot2** package. This function help your students in seeing patterns. This is an example of the `geom_smooth()` function. 

![`geom_smooth()` function, linear approximation](./files/07_visualization_geom_smooth.png)

When using `geom_smooth()`, the argument `method` has to be specified otherwise its default value will be used. Ask your students to set `method` as `'loess'`). The shaded areas around the lines are the confidence intervals which can be disabled by using the argument `se = FALSE`. 

geom_smooth() and stat_smooth() are effectively aliases: they both use the same arguments. Use stat_smooth() if you want to display the results with a non-standard geom. Ask students what the two lines suggest? What is the trend over time?


```{r}
p2 + geom_smooth(method = 'loess')
```
